# Recipr
A website for registered users to create and delete recipes.

## Quick start
To get started quickly, run command `rails dev:fake` in project folder to generate fake data. Then there'll be records in home page. To log in, check `lib/tasks/dev.rake` for usable email and password.

## Conclusion
To be honest, I spent more than 4 hours to do this homework because this is the first time I use Bootstrap and Ajax, but I really enjoyed to learn these interesting techniques.

And thanks there is a good tutorial `https://ihower.tw/rails/fullstack-ajax-1.html` for me to understand how to use Ajax in Rails easily.

The search and update features can be adapted in the future.
